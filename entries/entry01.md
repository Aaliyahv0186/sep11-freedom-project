Dear Diary, I am interested in using three.js for my freedom project. I used http://carvisualizer.plus360degrees.com/threejs/ , https://pablotheflamingo.com/ , and http://wildflower.resn.co.nz/ . The reason I am interested in this is because they use their platform for many different reasons, for example, it shows different car designs, costumizable flowers, even raising awareness on adopting flamingos. Three.js is also 3D and makes this website unique from the other websites. I am planning on maybe making a 3D anatomy of either human or animal with facts about them, I thought this would be really cool and resourceful but at the same time a really difficult task. I am going to try to attempt this and see how big my brain actually is.
